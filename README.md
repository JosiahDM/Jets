# Jets
##Week 2 Project at Skill Distillery

This week we began working with object oriented design and methodology. This repository models a
fleet of jets. Jets are their own objects, the Fleet is its own object, and Jets can have Pilots which
are also objects. The data was generated in internal arrays for this program.

The program is a text based CRUD app that will display all jets and pilots in the fleet, and also
allows creation of new jets and pilots. The user can also assign a pilot to specific jets if desired.



####Directions:

1. Compile the src/jets directory.


2. Run the CommandCenter class file.


3. Enter menu choice from number 1 to number 8.

    - Option 1 lists the entire fleet.
    - Option 2 displays the fastest jet.
    - Option 3 displays the jet with the longest range.
    - Option 4 will accept user input to add a jet to fleet. Enter the model name of the jet, then enter the top speed, the maximum range, and finally the price. The program will check for valid inputs and allow the user to correct before finalizing the input.
    - Option 5 hires a pilot. User must enter the name, age, and paygrade. Again, this will be validated before entry.
    - Option 6 allows the user to assign a pilot to a specific Jet. The user must know the name of the pilot and the ID of the jet to which to assign.
    - Option 7 lists all pilots. The names of the pilots can be found here if assignment is desired. Jet IDs are found in option 1.

4. After each choice press ENTER to continue, or the Q key to quit at that moment. Pressing ENTER will take the user back to the main menu.

5. From the main menu, entering the number 8 will exit the program.
